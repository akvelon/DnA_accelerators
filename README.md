## Accelerators
### ML, Streaming and Batch Data Processing
#### Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow
[Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) provide unified streaming and batch processing to power ML and streaming analytics use cases. [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) is a managed to run Apache Beam in coud with minimal latency and costs, and integrations with other Google Cloud products like [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and [Tensorflow TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx).
Akvelon, a [Google Cloud Service Partner](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/akvelon), and an active Apache Beam contributor and [Beam Summit](https://beamsummit.org/) partner, presents several of our favorite accelerators for Dataflow.
* [Salesforce to Txt](dataflow/flex-templates/salesforce-to-txt) - Flex templates for batch and streaming Salesforce data processing with Google Cloud Dataflow, using Apache Beam [CDAP IO](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/cdap/).
* [Salesforce to BigQuery](dataflow/flex-templates/salesforce-to-bigquery) - Flex templates for batch and streaming Salesforce data processing with Google Cloud Dataflow and BigQuery, using Apache Beam [CDAP IO](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/cdap/). Flex templates provide a comprehensive example of using Machine Learning (ML) to process streaming data in Dataflow, using Java multilanguage pipeline with Python transforms to run custom TFX and PyTorch [ML models](https://github.com/akvelon/DnA_accelerators/tree/dev/dataflow/ml/salesforce). This complete Flex template example also demonstrates creating and setting up [Expansion Service](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#multi-language-pipelines) in Dataflow to enable running custom Python transforms within a Java pipeline.
* [Tensorflow TFX model training with Apache Beam](dataflow/ml/salesforce/tfx/regression) - a Python notebook and Python Beam pipeline that demonstrates both Jupyter notebook to train a Tensorflow TFX ML model and the converted Python pipeline ready for Expansion Service use
* [PyTorch ML model training and Expansion Service for multilanguage pipelines with Apache Beam](dataflow/ml/salesforce/pytorch/anomaly_detection) - a complete example to train a PyTorch ML model using Apache Beam, convert the notebook to the Python pipeline, create custom Python Transforms and deploy as Apache Beam Expansion Service for Google Cloud Dataflow.

### Custom Visualizations
Akvelon has accumulated vast experience with data analytics, custom visualizations, dashboards, and reports for a wide range of  industries and use cases. Here are some of our favorite visualization accelerators.
#### Looker Visuals
* [Bubble Chart](https://avocado.software/custom-visuals/looker-bubble-chart) - Visualize your quantitative data easily with Bubble Chart by Akvelon.

This chart is a simplified version of the Scatter chart with tightly packed bubbles — this way you can show more categories in a given space. Additionally, Bubble chart allows to create groups of bubbles by providing an additional second category field. Also available on [https://github.com/akvelon/Looker-Bubble-Viz](https://github.com/akvelon/Looker-Bubble-Viz)
* [Bullet Chart](https://avocado.software/custom-visuals/bullet-chart) - The bulleted chart contains one main indicator (for example, income for the current year), compares this indicator with one or more other indicators in order to expand its value (for example, in comparison with the target indicator), and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of indicators, such as bad, satisfactory and good. Quality ranges are displayed as different intensities of the same shade to make them distinguishable for colorblind people and to minimize the use of colors on the dashboard.

#### PowerBI Visuals
* [Bubble Chart](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/wa104381340?tab=overview&exp=ubp8) - Visualize your quantitative data easily with Bubble Chart by Akvelon.
